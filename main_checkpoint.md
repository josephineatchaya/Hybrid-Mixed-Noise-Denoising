# Hybrid Denoising Framework for Remote Sensing Images

This repository contains the implementation and pretrained model for the manuscript:

**"Hybrid Denoising Framework for Remote Sensing Images: Integrating Spatial Filtering and Deep Learning for Mixed Noise and Shadow Removal"**

Submitted to *The Visual Computer* journal.

## üß† Overview

This hybrid framework addresses denoising of remote sensing images affected by mixed noise (salt-and-pepper + white Gaussian noise) and shadow artifacts. The pipeline combines:

- **CLAHE** for contrast enhancement in shadowed regions
- **MDBUTMF** to suppress salt-and-pepper noise
- **GCF** for structure-preserving smoothing
- **DnCNN** (deep CNN) for fine detail and texture restoration
- **AMOA** for adaptive parameter tuning based on image luminance

All components are integrated into a single script: `main.py`.
